Industrial IoT Anomaly Detection
================================

Overview
--------
This project aims to develop an anomaly detection system for industrial Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The system analyzes sensor data in real-time to detect anomalies that may indicate potential issues or abnormalities in industrial processes.

Features
--------
- Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest algorithm
- Real-time monitoring dashboard to visualize sensor readings and detected anomalies
- Customizable anomaly threshold
- Email/SMS alerts for significant anomalies
- Historical data analysis for trend detection and correlation analysis
- Interactive dashboard with zooming, panning, and time range selection
- Explanation of detected anomalies using SHAP values or partial dependence plots
- Integration with external systems for data exchange and analysis
- User authentication and access control
- Deployment on cloud platforms for scalability and reliability
- Feedback mechanism for continuous improvement

Usage
-----
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Industrial-IoT-Anomaly-Detection.git

2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the anomaly detection system:

python anomaly_detection.py

4. Open the dashboard in your web browser:

http://localhost:8050/


Configuration
-------------
- Adjust anomaly detection threshold in `anomaly_detection.py` file.
- Configure email/SMS alert settings in `alert.py` file.
- Customize dashboard layout and features in `dashboard.py` file.
